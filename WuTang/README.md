## How It's Made:
### Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

This is a WuTang name generator app where the user gets asked 5 survey questions, and depending on their answers they get their own WuTang name. The way the name is chosen is by giving each answer a numerical value which are added together to get a total. Each name lives in an array and we match the total to the index of the name in the array.

## What I Learned:
This project was one of my first introductions to node.js.
