# Wu-Tang Name Generator

### Goal
Create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names, but Wu-Tang sounding-ish names. Ex: Childish Gambino (who actually got his name from a Wu-Tang name generator).

### How It's Made
I used HTML and CSS+Flexbox to style, structure and position. I also utilized JavaScript to create the function which allows the user to answer questions and based off of the responses to those questions the program generates their WU TANG name.
