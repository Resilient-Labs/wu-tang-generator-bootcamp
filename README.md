# WuTang Name Generator
This project is a random name generator.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

User chooses out of three answers from five different questions. If two users choose the same answers they should receive the same names.

## Lessons Learned:

This project was quite interesting. I did not use abstract code because though I thought of creating an array, I did not want to derail from the initial idea. Extracted the value from the answers the user chose was an experience as well. It didn't click to parseInt until a bit later.
