## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on utilizing arrays, targeting their indexes, and finding a way to turn those indexes into numbers. By utilizing sum and sum minus % 3 I was able to put that answer into a variable. That variable was then used as a template literal and accessed in the innerText of the h2 element in the html. 

## Reflections:

It was tough running through some of the "maths" but we went through it together as a group a bunch and that definitely helped. It was really nice seeing the final product.
