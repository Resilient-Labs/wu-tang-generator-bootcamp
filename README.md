## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

I used HTML and CSS to style the web application by centering all of the content and adding a simple background image. Next I used JavaScript to link the JavaScript file to the JavaScript server file so that all of the logic is stored inside of the server file. Next I used Node.js to download packages and to host a local server for the web application.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that you can use the terminal to access files in your local directory. 
I learned that Node allows you to download packages and start hosting your server.
