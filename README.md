ðŸŽ¤ Wu-Tang Name Generator
Goal: Create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names, but Wu-Tang sounding-ish names. Ex: Childish Gambino (who actually got his name from a Wu-Tang name generator).


Created a name generator using a client-side approach. This was done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. User has 5 questions and if they answer all 5 questions the same way, it will populate the same answer.

If user inputs different answers for each respective question, then a different name will be generated.
