Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Word generator API

An application that allows the user to generate a pseudo random name inspired by the Wu-Tang Clan

Optimizations:

This was really fun to work on. It wasn't enough to just utilize already existing random word generator APIs/tools. Those tools are great but more often than not the words they generate are too random in composition or fail to produce names with any syntactic structure or inherent meaning. I had to come up with ways to assure that the name generated had some semblance of grammatical structure to present a convincing experience for the user. I utilized different dom nodes throughout the app outside of text area inputs to get creative with the way the user was allowed to generate the name. In the end I was also able to implement a feature to assess users current socioeconomic status.
