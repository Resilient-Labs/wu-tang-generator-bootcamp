# Wu-Tang Name Generator

## Goal: Create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name.

### How it's made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

What would your new name be? USing the Wu-tang name generator you too could have a sweet name like Childish Gambino. The user has to choose 5 questions for them to get a name. Each selection has a number value from 1-3. Those values correlate to the two array of names we provide.

### Lesson Learned:

The use of modulus in this logic really helped getting our name generator to work. It what help determine how the total collected value pin-points the index we need on the array. Math is cool.
