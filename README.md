# My Name Generator Project
Goal: Create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names, but Wu-Tang sounding-ish names. Ex: Childish Gambino (who actually got his name from a Wu-Tang name generator).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

## Lessons Learned:

For this project I used a simple if else statement to go check how many trues are checked within the html. The if else return a rapper's name.
