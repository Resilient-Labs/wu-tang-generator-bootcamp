# ðŸŽ¤Project: Wu-Tang Name Generator

## Goal: Create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names, but Wu-Tang sounding-ish names. Ex: Childish Gambino (who actually got his name from a Wu-Tang name generator).

### How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS
The HTML utilized the data value of radio buttons attach. Part of the project involved pushing the app to a server. The background styling is simple and just features the Wu-Tang logo.

### Lessons Learned
This project was easier than I made it out to be. I struggled to obtain the value from the radio button and tried to add them to get a score. I was unaware that it would return a string and concatenate the values as a single string.
