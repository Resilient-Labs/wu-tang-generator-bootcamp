## Wu-Tang Name Generator
I made a name generator based on the best rap group of all time, Wu-Tang Clan. 

**Link to project:** coming soon

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS

So I used built the name generator in two ways: 
- with vanilla JS
- with Node.JS
The vanilla JS takes in your input and decides to give you a fancy name based on your wonderful answers. Based on those answers, you can get name based on a wind type, water type, earth type and fire type. The node js can output an amazing name based on the powers of randomness and object-oriented programming(kinda want to enter a evil laugh here)



## Lessons Learned:

I learned that node.js is powerful and great for full-stack applications. I learned you have to write a if statement to get any background images to show up properly. Node does not directly interact for the DOM and vanilla js should handle user-input data
