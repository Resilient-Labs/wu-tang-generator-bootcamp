# ðŸŽ¤ Project: Wu-Tang Name Generator

### Goal: Create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names, but Wu-Tang sounding-ish names. Ex: Childish Gambino (who actually got his name from a Wu-Tang name generator).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

User is given five questions that determine their Wu-Tang name. I used a select html element to provide a dropdown menu. A number value is created when the user selects an option. Those values recived from the users selection are used as the index for the first and last name arrays declared in JS
