## Technical Details 🛠️

**Utilized Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Breakdown:

- **HTML:** Houses the 5-question survey form and the section to display the generated name.
  
- **CSS:** Gives the application a fun, user-friendly aesthetic. 
  
- **JavaScript:** The heart of the name generation:
  - Gathers user input from the survey.
  - Uses a combination of arrays and random selection logic to craft the name based on responses.
  - Presents the quirky name to the user.

## Tweaks & Enhancements 🔧

Initially, I employed a straightforward method of generating names. As the project evolved, I incorporated a more complex system using 10 values. By employing mathematics and calculating possible outcomes based on the survey answers, the name generation became more nuanced and engaging for the user.

## What I Discovered 🌟

- Incorporating user input in creative ways can elevate engagement and fun.
- Randomization in JavaScript has so many nuances; refining this aspect was both challenging and rewarding.
