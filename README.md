# About this project
This project uses a survey to generate Wu-Tang name for the user.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:
This was my first time using a server to generate a response. It was a little tricky trying to keep track of points based off of survey results and make that correspond to an output. I'd like to practice more with survery and JavaScript.
