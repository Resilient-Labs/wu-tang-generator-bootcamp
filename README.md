# Toontown Silly Name Generator

### Goal: Create a random name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names.

This project is inspired by Towntown's silly name generator, with a twist. In this case you can get your name by just answering a few questions about your personality.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project was not too difficult, but it was another good project to practice JavaScript. I assigned all of the select options to a value, and depending on the total number that came from the options chosen, is what name the user will get when they submit their answers.

## Lessons Learned:

I had fun with this project as it brought me back to my childhood again, and wrapping both the present and the past together. Ultimately, this project was also great practice for JavaScript.
