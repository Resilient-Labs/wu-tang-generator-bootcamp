# ðŸŽ¤ Wu-Tang Name Generator

### Goal: Create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names, but Wu-Tang sounding-ish names. Ex: Childish Gambino (who actually got his name from a Wu-Tang name generator).

### How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

To create this project, I first created 2 varibles that each contains 10 random names. I then created a function that consists of 5 varibles that targets the value for each varible. Finally, I created 2 final varibles named firstNameIndex and lastNameIndex. I assigned them both the value of the combined inputs and then added a Number function to convert our string input to a number from the index.


#### What I learned:

By working on this project I learned how to concatenate and assign numbers to produce randomly generated values.
