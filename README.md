# ðŸŽ¤ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Wu-Tang Name Generator

The goal of the project is to create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. The user is presented with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names, but Wu-Tang sounding-ish names. Ex: Childish Gambino (who actually got his name from a Wu-Tang name generator).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The project was create and designed with HTML and CSS with the CSS and HTML all in the html document. This was done in preparation for compartmentalizing code on the front end and back end. 

## Optimizations (Optional):

There could be additional optimazation by creating a more complex algorithm for name selection.


## Lessons Learned:

Lesson learned her were how to work with code that is not in two separate files, while also pointing to a separate javscript file. I also realized that online survey can have any algorithm in the back end running it, we may make assumptions about the logic, but we do not really know unless we can see the code.
