# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, API, JSON, Node.js

# Optimizations:
#### Calculation of total user score done client side is sent to a back end server created with Node.js. The back end stores the array of Wu Names which sends the corresponding name back to the client, which hides possible Wu Tang names from users.

# Lesson Learned:
#### I was able to keep client side javascript minimal and clean by making it OOP and keeping calculations and name storage to the server side. I also learned the use of the spread operator to help keep the code efficient by making them separate arguments into my function.
