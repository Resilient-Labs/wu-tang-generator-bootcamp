# ðŸŽ¤ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Wu-Tang Name Generator

### Goal: Create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names, but Wu-Tang sounding-ish names. Ex: Childish Gambino (who actually got his name from a Wu-Tang name generator).

### TECH used: HTML5, CSS3. JS ES6, and Node.JS

### How I did it:

- Set up a server that sends and receive requests for HTML, CSS, and JS pages
- The html page will load five select tags that each have 2 options
- Created a function that converts the answers to value and then fetch a requests to the server
- Based on the request the server would respond a response and show it in the DOM
